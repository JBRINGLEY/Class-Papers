[*Facial Recognition Using Principal Component Analysis.*](https://github.com/JBRINGLEY/Class-Papers/blob/master/Facial%20Recognition%20Using%20PCA.pdf)

Implentation Project I did for an image analysis class in undergad. The mathematics of the PCA algorithm are explained in detail, the steps of the algorithm are then implemented in MATLAB. The final product is a facial recognition system allowing users to choose an image to be matched with a face in the training data set. The paper also includes a literature review of previous work done regarding the Eigenface method. 

*Hard Margin Support Vector Machines and Kernel Methods.*

This paper examines much of the theory and mathematics behind the hard margin support vector classifier and kernel methods. My goal here was to try and intuitively explain the fundamental ideas behind SVM and their relationship to kernel methods.
